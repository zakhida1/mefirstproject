PROJECT DESCRIPTION - PASSWORD GENERATOR

The Password Generator project creates a Java program that generates secure,customizable passwords based on user-defined criteria.Users can specify the minimum and maximum password length,choose to include lowercase letters and uppercase letters,digits and symbols and even define custom character sets.The program generates a random password that adheres to these specifications and evaluates its strength based on factors like length and character diversity

KEY FEATURES:
Customizable Password Criteria:users can define password length, include and exclude specific character types and provide custom character sets
Password Strength Evaluation:The program evaluates the password's strength,categorizing it as "Weak," "Moderate,""Strong," or "Very Strong."
Secure Random Generation:Utilizes SecureRandom for password generation to ensure randomness n security

ALGORITHMS USED:
Random Generation:SecureRandom generates random password

CHALLENGES:
Input Validation:Handling invalid user inputs(like entering letters instead of numbers) was a challenge solved with exception handling
Writing the Code:Writing the code for this project was  very difficult and i used AI and informations from Google
